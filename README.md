# Linux_Commands

This repo contains notes of all the Linux and MacOS commands that I am learning.
I learned the commands using the Colt steeleÂ´s **The Linux Command Bootcamp** from Udemy.com.

The purpose is to learn a few commands here and there and slowly build my understanding of the topic.

The notes were taken using the **Pages** app of my Macbook.
