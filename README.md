# Linux_Commands

This repo contains notes of all the Linux and MacOS commands that I am learning.
I learned the commands using the Colt steeleÂ´s **The Linux Command Bootcamp** from Udemy.com.

The purpose is to learn a few commands here and there and slowly build my understanding of the topic.

The notes were taken using the **Pages** app of my Macbook.

Notes will also be added to this **README.md** file so other developers can easily reference commands that they might need.
